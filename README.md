Modify some problems in "Sugar Candy login", and make the theme adapted to Blue Archive (my favorite game)

![Preview](/Previews/PartialBlur.png "Preview")

# Usage

## Manual Installation

Fitstly, download the zip file from release page. Then unzip it to your sddm theme directory '`/usr/share/sddm/themes`' (May be different in your os)

```bash
sudo tar -xzvf ~/arona-sddm-login.tar -C /usr/share/sddm/themes
```

After that you will have to point SDDM to the new theme by editing its config file, preferrably at /etc/sddm.conf (create if necessary). You can take the default config file of SDDM as a reference which might be found at: /usr/lib/sddm/sddm.conf.d/sddm.conf.

In the `[Theme]` section simply add the themes name to this line: `Current=arona-sddm-login`.

## Automatic Installation (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NewmoomCat/reisa-sddm-login.git
cd reisa-sddm-login
bash install.sh
```
